# AudioTimeStretch
AudioTimeStretch
The goal of this project is:
 1. Lightweight,audio  timestretching algorithms written in C.
 2. Input will be be wav file, output should be wav file.
 3. Example test input is: example_input1.wav, example_input2.wav
 4. First step is to simplify the existing codebase, last attempt at Wsola algorithm failed miserably, it is coded in jay_wsola.c
 5. Developing tests for submodules and documentation of key input/outputs for submodules is fairly important.
