# AudioTimeStretch
AudioTimeStretch
The goal of this project is:
 1. Lightweight,audiotime stretching algorithms written in C.
 2. Input will be be wav file file, output should be wav file.
 3. Example test input is in example_input1.wav, example_input2.wav
 4. First step is to simplify the existing codebase, last attempt at Wsola algorithm failed miserably, it is coded in Jay-Wsola.c
 5. References for Wsola algorithm are here:
